# Aryan Desai - Cybersecurity Portfolio

Welcome to my personal cybersecurity portfolio â€” an interactive, modern, and fully static web app showcasing my skills, projects, and experience in cybersecurity.

This portfolio is built using **React**, **Vite**, and **Tailwind CSS**, with all data managed locally in JSON files for simplicity and speed. It is deployed on **GitHub Pages** for easy public access.


## ðŸ›  Technology Used

- **React** (with TypeScript) for building a responsive, component-based UI  
- **Vite** for fast development and optimized builds  
- **Tailwind CSS** for clean, utility-first styling  
- **Chart.js** for dynamic charts and data visualization  
- Static JSON files for all content â€” no backend or database dependencies  
- Hosted on **GitHub Pages**


## ðŸš© Key Features

- Terminal-inspired animated interface reflecting cybersecurity themes  
- Interactive dashboards displaying skills proficiency and threat monitoring  
- Detailed sections highlighting my education, professional experience, certificationd and projects  
- Contact form UI (front-end only) to facilitate connections  
- System status simulation with mocked terminal logs for an authentic feel
